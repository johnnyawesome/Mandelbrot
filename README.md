## More information
I also wrote [a blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-mandelbrot-set-in-p5js/) about the Mandelbrot set, describing everything in great detail!

From the formula, and it's individual components, down to every single line of code used here. I described everything.

The  [Julia Set](hhttps://github.com/johnnyawesome/JuliaSet) is very closely related to the Mandelbrot set. Check out [this Project](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/JuliaSet)
for the code, and  [this blogpost](https://breaksome.tech/coding-the-julia-set-in-p5js/) to learn more about it.

Turns out, the [Logistic Map / Bifurcation Diagram](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/LogisticMap) is also very closely related to the Mandelbrot set.
